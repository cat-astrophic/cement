## Economic, Environmental, and Technical Gains from the Kyoto Protocol:<br>Evidence from Cement Manufacturing

This repo contains the code and data for a project studying the effect of the Kyoto Protocol on cement manufacturing, CO2 emissions from cement manufacturing, technical gains in cement production, and carbon leakage. An earlier version of this paper served as my second year paper for the NRE PhD program. This is also the first chapter of my dissertation and is currently under review at *TBD*.
